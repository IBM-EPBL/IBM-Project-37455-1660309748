3.PYTHON IS A POPULAR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:

When Guido van Rossum was creating python in the 1980s, he made sure to design it to be a
general-purpose language. One of the main reasons for the popularity of python would be its
simplicity in syntax so that it could be easily read and understood even by amateur
developers also.

Python was created more than 30 years ago, which is a lot of time for any community of
programming language to grow and mature adequately to support developers ranging from
beginner to expert levels.

There are plenty of documentation, guides and Video Tutorials for Python language are
available that learner and developer of any skill level or ages can use and receive the support
The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because
it has simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural
language.

Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much
faster than other programming languages.

4.FRAMEWORKS USED WITH PYTHON:

1. DJANGO

Django is an open-source, full-stack Python framework. It follows the DRY (Don’t Repeat
Yourself) principle. Django comes equipped with a vast line of ready-to-use libraries. Some
of its most exceptional features are authentication, URL routing, template engine, objectrelational mapper (ORM), and database schema migrations. Together, these make Django
highly scalable, fast, and versatile.

2. PYRAMID

Another open-source Python framework on our list is Pyramid. It runs on Python 3 and aims
to accomplish as much as possible with minimal complexity. Perhaps the best feature of
Pyramid is its ability to run well with both small and large applications. Some of the key
highlights of this framework include Routes, HTML form validation and generation, textbased templating, URL mapping based on Routes configuration via WebHelpers, and URL
dispatch.

3. TURBOGEARS

TurboGears is an open-source, data-driven, full-stack Python framework. It incorporates
some of the best components of other Python frameworks and comes with many useful
libraries. It allows developers to build data-driven web applications very fast.

4. WEB2PY

Web2py is a highly scalable, open-source full-stack Python framework. It comes with its
individual web-based IDE that includes a code editor, debugger, and a one-click deployment
feature.

5. CHERRYPY

CherryPy is one of the oldest open-source, object-oriented Python microframeworks.
Following a minimalistic approach, CherryPy is designed for extensibility. It includes
mechanisms for hook points and extensions. Moreover, the “cherry” on top is that any
CherryPy-based web application is a standalone Python application having its unique
embedded multi-threaded web server.

6. FLASK

Flask is a Python microframework available under the BSD license. It drew inspiration from
the Sinatra Ruby framework. Flask requires Jinja2 template and Werkzeug WSGI toolkit to
run. It has a lightweight and modular design that makes it easily adaptable to a wide range of
development needs.

7. SANIC

Sanic is an Asynchronous framework built on top of uvloop. It is a simple Python framework
developed explicitly for offering fast HTTP responses via asynchronous request handling.
Since Sanic supports asynchronous request handlers, it is compatible with Python 3.5’s
‘Async’ and ‘Await’ functions. This helps to enhance its speed further.
